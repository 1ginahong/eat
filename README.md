Eat Now is an app to help you decide where to eat.

## Mission
Hereâ€™s to the indecisive ones. The hesitant. The ditherers. The fence-sitters. The donkey between two haystacks. The ones who can never make a decision. 

We built Eat Now for us. We'll help you pick the best restaurant for any occasion. It's that simple.

## Features
